## General purpose 
Obsidian can be just a very simple note taking software. But it can also be used as a "second brain", a trendy way to say that your notes are so well organized that you can rely on them not to remember everything, or to keep everything in your head at all times. 
This open-source software was created to use links and tags, which can be represented as a graph. There are many ways to use these two properties to organize your knowledge, your projects or even your notes...
The main goal when using Obsidian is to take advantage of its graph to organize your knowledge or you thinking by tiny parts and linking them together. 


## Installation
Please follow the instructions on the [Obsidian official website](https://obsidian.md/download). 

## Basics 
### Links
Use [[NoteTitle]] in anote to create a link to another one.

Example 
> Our approach uses a [[video diffusion model]] (which could link to [[diffusion model]], that could link to [[Markov Chain]]) to combine, at inference time, the low-resolution spatio-temporal information from the original video with new, high resolution information that it synthesized to align with the guiding [[[]]].
